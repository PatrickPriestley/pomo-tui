# ADHD-Optimized Configuration for pomo-tui
# 
# This configuration is specifically designed for users with ADHD,
# focusing on features that support executive function and sustained attention.
#
# Key principles:
# - Shorter sessions to match ADHD attention spans
# - Gentle transitions and reminders
# - Ambient sound for focus
# - Visual cues and progress tracking
# - Flexible break scheduling
# - Recovery support for interrupted sessions

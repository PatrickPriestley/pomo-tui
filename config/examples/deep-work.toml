# Deep Work Configuration for pomo-tui
#
# This configuration is optimized for deep work sessions as described
# in Cal Newport's "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World"
#
# Key principles:
# - Longer, uninterrupted focus sessions (45-90 minutes)
# - Fewer but more substantial breaks
# - Complete distraction elimination
# - Environmental optimization for sustained attention
# - Emphasis on high-value, cognitively demanding work

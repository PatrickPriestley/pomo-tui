# Feature Specification: ADHD-Focused Pomodoro Terminal Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-terminal`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a terminal-based productivity application that combines task management with pomodoro timing specifically designed for users with ADHD. The application runs entirely in the terminal using a text-based interface with keyboard navigation. Users can create, edit, prioritize, and track tasks through a clean list interface. The timer component provides 25-minute focus sessions with customizable break periods (5-minute short breaks, 15-30 minute long breaks after 4 sessions). The interface displays current timer state, remaining time with visual progress indicators, and current task context. Between sessions, the application provides gentle transition support including optional breathing exercises and movement reminders. Focus enhancement features include automatic website blocking during active sessions and ambient sound integration (brown noise, white noise). The application integrates with common CLI development tools - automatically updating git commit messages with session context, syncing with GitHub issues and Jira tasks, setting Slack status during focus periods. All data persists locally in SQLite database with export capabilities. The interface prioritizes minimal cognitive load with clear visual hierarchy, consistent keyboard shortcuts, and distraction-free design. Sessions can be paused, extended, or stopped with proper state preservation. Daily and weekly productivity statistics show completion patterns without creating pressure or guilt. The application works offline-first and starts instantly without dependencies."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with ADHD, I want a distraction-free terminal application that helps me manage tasks and maintain focus through structured work sessions, so that I can improve my productivity while accommodating my attention management needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has launched the application, **When** they create a new task, **Then** the task appears in their task list with a priority level and can be selected for focus sessions
2. **Given** a user has selected a task and started a pomodoro session, **When** 25 minutes elapse, **Then** the timer alerts them and automatically transitions to a break period with optional breathing exercises
3. **Given** a user is in an active focus session, **When** they have website blocking enabled, **Then** distracting websites become inaccessible until the session ends
4. **Given** a user completes 4 focus sessions, **When** the fourth session ends, **Then** the system suggests a long break of 15-30 minutes
5. **Given** a user has GitHub integration enabled, **When** they complete a focus session, **Then** their git commit messages automatically include session context
6. **Given** a user has Slack integration enabled, **When** they start a focus session, **Then** their Slack status updates to indicate they are in focus mode
7. **Given** a user wants to review their productivity, **When** they access statistics, **Then** they see completion patterns without pressure-inducing metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user needs to pause mid-session for an urgent interruption?
- How does the system handle network connectivity loss during integration syncs?
- What occurs if a user attempts to start a session without selecting a task?
- How does the application manage conflicting keyboard shortcuts with the terminal emulator?
- What happens when export fails due to insufficient disk space?
